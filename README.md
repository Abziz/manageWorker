## Developing

### Built With
List main libraries, frameworks used including versions (React, Angular etc...)

### Prerequisites
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.

* [Node v10](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Setting up Dev
Download extensions in VScode:
* [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github)
* [ESlient](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
* [Node.js Modules intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=leizongmin.node-module-intellisense)
* [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)


```shell

cd your-project/
npm init
npm install express
npm install -g eslint
npm install nodemon -D
```
 
And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Deploying / Publishing
give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

using the project.

## Tests

Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
npm run test
