# ManageWorker

A brief description of your project, what it is used for.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up & running.

```shell
npm init
npm install express
npm install nodemon -D
```

## Running

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

To start the program, run the following command:

```shell
npm start
```

## Developing

### Built With
List main libraries, frameworks used including versions (React, Angular etc...)

### Prerequisites
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.

* [Node v10](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
cd your-project/
npm install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Deploying / Publishing
give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
npm run test
```

## Style guide

Explain your code style and show how to check it.

## Api Reference

If the api is external, link to api documentation. If not describe your api including authentication methods as well as explaining all the endpoints with their required parameters.
